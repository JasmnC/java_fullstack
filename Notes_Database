Transactions
- a group of query that execute together

Optimistic lock vs pestimistic lock
- optemistic: we don't assume there's any error, we allow concurrency assume there's no conflicts
  - so how do we maintain thread safe?
  - we have @Version spring-data-jpa will check / track -> but this is manual
  - if things goes right, it's going to faster
  - in JDBC you can also deal with and we use try-catch-finally block
* implementation depends on what tool you chose, trade off pros and cons
