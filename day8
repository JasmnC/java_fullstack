What is maven?
  A auto building tool.
  pain-point to solve: 1. dependency management -> under external libraries it's not just download jdk-jar files and done, you also have to import it 100 times
                       1.5. Volurnbility detection -> since it takes control of jdk-jars, maven helps keep track of the known bugs(mvnrepository.com)/
                         download from central library to avoid melicious malware
                       2. package and scope management
                         -> manditory in pom.xml: groupId, artifactId, version
                         -> have a universal place to save all package
                       3. Life cycle management -> see the target folder, if you need a jar file to deploy to prod. 
                                                  * click the package, it's going to go through the target folder, clean>reload>verify....see lifecycle it's in the exact order
  * command+',' to access setting in IntelliJ, find maven under Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Maven
  - repos
    local vs central
    sort on machine at ~/.m2/repository by default <-> https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2
  - setting.xml
    -> set up proxy, servers, mirror, profiles, reporitory
  - pom.xml(project object model)
    -> dependencies, plug-in, build settings
    *is the main config file for maven project
    -> dependency coordinates: groupId, artifacts, version

  - mavean Lifecycle
    validate (check project stucture), compile(compile source code), test(run tests), package(build JAR), install (copy to local repo), deploy(publish to remote repo)
    *can find on the right hand side panel when we click on maven
