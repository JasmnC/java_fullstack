What is maven?
  it is a auto building tool
  pain-point to solve: 1. dependency management -> under external libraries it's not just download jdk-jar files and done, you also have to import it 100 times
                       1.5. Volunbility detection -> since it takes control of jdk-jars, maven helps keep track of the known bugs(mvnrepository.com)/
                         download from central library to avoid melicious malware
                       2. package and scope management
                         -> manditory in pom.xml: groupId, artifactId, version
