How does multiple spring boots communicate with each other?
Synchronise style
- REST endpoint with HTTP/HTTPS
  - but whoever sent the request has to hang there
  - when you see for processors, for example Intel Xeon, 288 p-core, 128 e-core, 
    let's say we can have 10 threads(but 2threads/core is more practical) on each core, it's only able to handle 4k users at one time
  - so we want to avoid syncronise in web-app
Asynchronous style
- message queue
- problem: if downstream is down, upstream wouldn't know(stuck in await) -> implement actuator, but what if there's tens of thousands of them?
  -> service discovery
- monitor

* if ALL of your servers are down, you're fucked, but at least tell the user tell them 1. page is under maintenance; 
2. send a message said order received/confirmed, and dump all orders into database first -> reservoir solution(for some business)
