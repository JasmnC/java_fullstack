Spring framework
1. A: AOP
  - aspect oriented programming
  - @Aspect: you can have different aspect doing different things, within the aspects, you can define:
            -> logic(what I want to do),
            (when) @Before(@annotation(com.example.annotation.Cachable)), @After, @AfterReturning, @AfterThrowing, @Around
            -> @Pointcut("execution(*com.example.Service.UserService.*(...))")
                public void myPointCutExecution(){}
  * this is quite practical, make sure to know how to do it, what are the annotations you use, where did you use the AOP
2. I: IOC
