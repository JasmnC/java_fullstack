Singleton
Lazy loading
Eager loading
//lazy loading
public class Singleton{
    private static Singleton instance;
    private Singleton(){
    }
    public static Singleton getInstance(){
        if (instance==null){
            instance=new Singleton;;
        }
        Return instance
    }
}

Access Modifier: public, private, default*, protected*考點
default is the default, gives package level accessibility for field, method, class
protected=default+sub-class(gives parent/child access)
private is only available in class

What is Class?
Class is a template
* object/instance vs template ->objects should declare by new keyword
* other templates include Interface, Abstract Class, (not a template but a annotation) enum
 
Static keyword
It’s a method
Access elements from template
JVM calls it, and only executed once when loading, compile before run
* JVM’s structure –> contains stack, heap, PC register, method area, native method area
Static are sorted in method area

Final keyword
It’s a modifier, can be apply on field, method, class
For field: the value can only be assign once, means reference cannot be change, but the object itself can still be update
For method: can not be override by sub-class
For class: can not be extend, often used for Immutable class
* Immutable: 
declare final
declare private
only use getters, no setters
actively do deep copy

Override vs Overload
both concepts of polymorphism
Run time <--> compile time
In between classes(parent child) <--> within the same class

Factory Design Pattern
Scenario e-commerce is using 2 payment method, say paypal and cc
Double vs double:
double is primitive, Double is referenced data type 
* 8 primitive byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean, char
Java uses wrapper class and autoboxing(Double) to make primitive behave like objects, to achieve OOP

Exception Handling
Throw vs Throws
Use in the function <-> use in the function signature
“try-catch-finally”
Types of exceptions: runtime, compile time
All errors came from throwable class unless handled by try-catch
Exceptions vs Error
Can be handle in code <->can not be handle in code(ex: StackOverFlow or OutOfMemory)

Collections: Lists
ArrayList vs LinkedList
Access by index <-> Had to iterate through
HashMap vs HashSets

OOP
Inheritance -> interface + abstract class +final
Encapsulation -> access modifier
Polymorphism -> override vs overload
Abstraction ->interface + abstract class

SOLID
They are Achrinom for principles
S: single responsibility
O: open/closed
L: Lonskov principle
D: dependency injection
