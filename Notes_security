who you are   <-> what you can do
fail? 401     <-> 403
* Role-base control by authentication

                who you are
                    |

            -----user/passwrd---->


*how do they check? it's all aop
*how to do it in spring security

How to avoid repeatly checkiing authentication?
Toekn save in cookie
JWT token (most popular type)->3 parts{header, payload, signiture
* header is like HS256 type: JWT, payload name: David, id:101, signiture is like  header+salt(going to be a very long random info)
Bearer token

sticky session -> if it's from this IP, always use this server

Login via google account:
you never sign up -> means you never have a username/password -> then how they know who you are and let you in?
- google do it for them, you have to register with gmail server, they will give you an app_id
- sign-in request get *redirect* to gmail server
- redirect URL, app_id
- OIDC (open ID connector)
